# Medical-Diagnosis-using-AI
Medical conditions like Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Lung Cancer, and 
Hypo-Thyroid significantly impact global health. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective 
treatment and better outcomes. This project introduces an AI-based web application that 
predicts these conditions using machine learning models. The application leverages 
Streamlit for a user-friendly interface and integrates multiple predictive models for 
comprehensive medical assessment. 

The system includes five predictive models: 
• Diabetes Prediction Model: Uses metrics like pregnancies, glucose levels, BMI, 
and age to assess diabetes risk. 
• Heart Disease Prediction Model: Evaluates factors such as cholesterol, blood 
pressure, and chest pain types for detecting heart-related issues. 
• Parkinson’s Disease Prediction Model: Utilizes voice-based features like Jitter, 
Shimmer, and NHR to identify Parkinson’s risk. 
• Lung Cancer Prediction Model: Considers lifestyle indicators such as smoking 
habits, anxiety, and shortness of breath for prediction. 
• Hypo-Thyroid Prediction Model: Uses hormone levels like TSH, T3, and TT4 to 
assess thyroid conditions. 

By integrating these models into a single platform, the tool empowers users to receive 
immediate insights about potential health risks. The system demonstrates how AI can bridge 
the gap between complex medical data and practical diagnostic tools, offering significant 
potential to improve health outcomes and promote early detection strategies.
